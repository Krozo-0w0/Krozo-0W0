## About me
Hi everyone, I'm Krozo, and I am a meticulous and diligent student. I will ensure that projects are finished on time and working perfectly. Although I may not be a fast learner, I compensate for it by working hard and paying attention to detail. I believe that being nervous and overthinking can be beneficial traits, as they reflect a careful and thorough approach to tasks. I am deeply immersed in programming, using my analytical prowess to solve different problems. I feel fulfilled and satisfied when I solve problems and accomplish tasks. It's a pleasure to meet you.

<summary><h3>My Social Network</h3></summary>
    <center>
        My friends and family are my main source of inspiration, and they are the ones who helped me reach my current self. My parents inspired me to be a resilient and ethical person. My friends, on the other hand, share similar interests and have inspired me to pursue my current career. <br> <br>

As a child, I was very interested in how things work, especially how we use technology to play games and even work. This curiosity inspired me to learn more about how technology works through different tech communities and led me to pursue a career as a computer science student, as I find it fascinating to bring your imagination into reality through coding.
