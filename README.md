## About me
Hi everyone, I'm Ford, and I am a meticulous and diligent student. I will ensure that projects are finished on time and are working perfectly. Although I may not be a fast learner, I compensate for it by working hard and paying attention to detail. I believe that being nervous and overthinking can be beneficial traits, as they reflect a careful and thorough approach to tasks. I am deeply immersed in programming, using my analytical prowess to solve different problems. I feel fulfilled and satisfied when I solve problems and accomplish tasks. It's a pleasure to meet you.
